Sure, here are some test scenarios that you can use to validate the business logic of the `Review` class:

1. **Test with valid parameters**:
   - Create a `Review` object with a valid `body`, `created`, and `updated`.
   - Verify that the `body`, `created`, and `updated` fields are correctly set.

2. **Test with null body**:
   - Try to create a `Review` object with a null `body`.
   - Verify that an exception is thrown because the `body` cannot be null.

3. **Test with null created and updated**:
   - Try to create a `Review` object with null `created` and `updated`.
   - Verify that the `created` and `updated` fields are set to the current time.

4. **Test with future created and updated**:
   - Try to create a `Review` object with a `created` and `updated` in the future.
   - Verify that an exception is thrown because the `created` and `updated` cannot be in the future.

5. **Test with past created and updated**:
   - Try to create a `Review` object with a `created` and `updated` in the past.
   - Verify that the `created` and `updated` fields are correctly set.

6. **Test with empty body**:
   - Try to create a `Review` object with an empty `body`.
   - Verify that the `body` field is correctly set to an empty string.

7. **Test with very long body**:
   - Try to create a `Review` object with a `body` that is too long.
   - Verify that an exception is thrown because the `body` cannot be too long.

Remember, these are just test scenarios. The actual implementation of these tests will depend on the specifics of your application and how you handle validation.
